	Select the queries you want to commit. Committing means the changes will
	become public. You can also opt to not commit certain queries yet, or to
	drop them completely.
</p>
<p>
	Please note that the queries are executed in order of their timestamps.
	Hence, if you drop or ignore queries somewhere in the middle, subsequent
	queries might fail. MonAd will notify you of this and show the conflict
	so you can resolve it first.

	If you're sure all your changes are correct, it's usually the simplest
	to just commit everything in the queue.
